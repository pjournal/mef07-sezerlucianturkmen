# ABOUT ME

Greetings! I'm **SEZER TÜRKMEN**, a software developer whose journey spans the realms of architecture and coding. In a nutshell:

### From Architect to Code Creator: My Transition

I initially ventured into the world of architecture, my first passion. My studies took me to Italy, where I delved into multi-scale architecture and sustainable design, honing my eye for detail and love for harmonious structures.

After working as an architect for a considerable period, I felt the magnetic pull towards coding. The allure of shaping digital landscapes was irresistible, prompting a career shift.

### Mastering Full Stack Development

As a software developer, I immersed myself in coding, mastering Java and venturing into full-stack development. I used technologies like Spring Boot and React to craft dynamic, user-friendly applications. Kubernetes and Docker added efficiency and scalability to my toolkit, bridging the worlds of traditional and digital architecture.

My journey is guided by the belief in perpetual learning. I attended a coding bootcamp to refine my skills and gain practical insights, cementing my passion for coding. As a software developer, I enjoy creating elegant, user-centric applications.

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's in Information Technologies at MEF University, ensuring my knowledge stays cutting-edge.

### Life Beyond Tech

Outside of coding and architecture, I find joy in cooking, a creative outlet where flavors and textures are my canvas. Staying active is another passion. Whether it's hitting the gym or enjoying indoor cycling with a spirited playlist, I cherish the rhythm and precision of physical activity.

### The Future Awaits

I'm Sezer Türkmen, a full-stack developer, architect, and a lover of life. My mission is to blend creativity and technology, one line of code at a time. Thank you for getting to know me!
